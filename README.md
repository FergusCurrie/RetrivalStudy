# Scheduler 


After reading these books I decided on a new apporach to learning:
https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013
https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU

This python script uses the 'SuperMemo' algorithm to schedule practice questions. 
To use the scripts there will be a series of questions due each day - similar to spaced repetition flash cards like anki.
However I would like these to be slower questions to answer, and occur less frequently. I would also like the recall time to be noisy, this will prevent so called over studying and force retention.
